# Sluis

## What is this?

Itâ€™s a small Sinatra application which provides a RESTful API to deploy projects managed with [fastlane](http://www.fastlane.tools).

## How I use it?

Sluis provides automated project deployment *only* for projects that supports sluis integration.
Any attempt to deploy projects which are not supported will immediatelly fail.

#### Output parameters

```

### Deploy a managed project

Takes a JSON body which contains the name of lane used by `fastlane` when deploying

#### Input parameters

- __lane__ (string, required) The name of the lane used by *fastlane*

```
